# InstaLike

**Note:** *Instagram switched their API model for non-approved developers from request-limitations into a sandbox-mode, which made this script useless for them. Therefore the maintenance for this code has been discontinued and is probably deprecated. However, the code and the system itself is very interesting to share.*

## What is InstaLike:

InstaLike is a simple php script, written by a noob, which ran every 5 minutes as a cronjob and looked up the newest picture being uploaded of five given hashtags. Each of these photos were being liked.

All I needed was:
- 5 apps registered in the Instagram API platform with the limitation of 20 requests per hour
- 1 Instagram account which should get the followers
- 5 Tokens that were given by connecting the account with the 5 apps
- 5 Hashtags which are corresponding with the photos of the Instagram account

## So, you like pictures automatically with that script, but how do I get followers?

Psychology is doing the rest. People who see someone liking their photo are getting your attention and might either be interested in your account regarding the content or just expect a follow-back and then hit the "follow"-button.

## Did it really work?
Just try it yourself, the script is simply replacing human interaction. Reenacting the performance of the script will probably give you the same result, but it's a waste of valuable time. I first did it on my own and came up with the idea to automate it. It was amazing to wake up in the morning and see that I gained up to 60-100 Followers within a night.

*But keep in mind that you only get attention with this script. Your content has to be interesting too.*
